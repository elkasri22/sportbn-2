# React.js Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run this React.js project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) (v23 or later recommended) 
* A [**code editor**](https://vscodium.com/#install)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download the Project

Download as ZIP

* Click the **Code** button on GitHub and select **Download ZIP**.
* Extract the ZIP file to your preferred directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
bun install
```
This will install all required dependencies listed in package.json.

### 3. Run the Development Server

To start the React app in development mode, run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

* The app should automatically open in your browser at **localhost**.
* Changes you make to the code will hot-reload.

### 4. Build for Production

When you're ready to deploy, create an optimized production build:

```bash
 bun run build
```

The built files will be in the **dist/** folder.

## Final Notes
* Always run `bun install` after downloading the project.
* Use `bun run dev` for development and `bun run build` before deploying.
